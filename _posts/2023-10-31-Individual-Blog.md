### My First Trimester Adventure: Code, Collaboration, and Geoestimater

### introduction
Greetings, fellow coding enthusiasts! As I reflect on my journey through the first trimester, I'm excited to share the highs, the challenges, and the incredible learning experiences that unfolded during these eventful weeks.

### Setting the Stage:
The trimester kicked off with the creation of my main repository and a meticulous tool check. I also embarked on the exciting journey of building my personal blog. However, the real adventure began when I formed a dynamic duo with my friend, Esahann.

### The Duo
Esahann and I faced our fair share of challenges, falling a bit behind initially. But the spirit of collaboration and determination soon propelled us forward. In the first week, we achieved milestones like an overview of tools and equipment, setting up VSCode and GitHub Pages, building a student page, and a unique 'pair showcase.'

### The Pair Showcase
In this showcase, I unveiled a point game on my personal blog and showcased additions to our website. Alongside, I delved into Python, absorbing the basics of coding through videos—a pivotal step that laid the groundwork for the weeks to come.

### TEAM
By week three, our duo transformed into a quartet as Tucker and William joined the ranks. Together, we dove into the Agile Methodology, setting the stage for a collaborative and efficient journey ahead.

### Test Showcases and Team Teaching
A series of test showcases introduced us to web programming basics, with a hiccup in my first attempt that I swiftly overcame. The team teaching assignment then led us into the intricate realm of algorithms. I scoured online resources, gaining insights into data abstraction, boolean logic, iterations, and more.

### Passion Project
The climax of the trimester arrived with our passion project—Geoestimater, a captivating game where participants guessed countries based on silhouettes or flags. Taking charge of the back end, I delved into AWS, contributing numerous variables to enhance the project's functionality.

### Night at the Museum

The night of the museum showcased the culmination of everyone's hard work. Our project stood proudly among others, a testament to our collaborative efforts and dedication.
